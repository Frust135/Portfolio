		description:
			"Reinforcement Learning empowers agents to make decisions in environments with the aim of maximizing a defined reward. In the area of robotic exploration, the challenge lies in enabling the agent to navigate its surroundings while avoiding dangerous states. Contextual affordance, a predictive model, anticipates the consequences of actions based on the agentâ€™s current state. This model proves invaluable in guiding the agent away from dangerous situations. In the pursuit of enhancing robotic exploration safety, this paper examines the efficacy of a robotic agent employing contextual affordance to steer clear of unsafe states during exploration...",
